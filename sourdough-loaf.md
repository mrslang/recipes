# Sourdough Loaf

## Ingredients

### First Step

- 450g bread flour
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 100g starter (6-8 hours after feeding)
- 325g lukewarm water (100F)

### Second Step

- 25g lukewarm water (100F)
- 10g salt

## Steps

In a large bowl, add all "First Step" ingredients. Mix by hand until incorporated and cover.

Let rest in a warm spot in your kitchen for about 30 to 40 minutes. Internal temp of the dough should be around 80F.

Sprinkle the salt over the dough and sprinkle with the rest of the water. Mix by hand, pinching the dough to dissolve the salt, and stretching and folding the dough over itself.

Cover and let it rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes.

Let rise for 3 hours, stretching and folding with a wet hand every 30 minutes, until the dough is buoyant and aerated.

Using a dough scraper, gently coax the dough out of the bowl onto an unfloured work surface. Lightly flour the top of the dough, and divide it in half with a bench scraper. With the bench scraper, flip the dough pieces so that the floured side is on the bottom.

Shape the dough pieces into boules by gently folding the dough over itself from all "sides." Flip the shaped dough over so that the seam side is on the counter. Using a bench scraper, draw the loaf toward you, and then away from you, to tighten up the top of the dough. Cover each piece with a towel and let rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, dust two bannetons or towel lined bowls with a 50-50 mixture of wheat and rice flour.

After the 10 minutes, flip the dough over, and reshape the loaf one more time. Flip the loaf back over, seam side down, and place the bench scraper under the shaped loaf. Push it around from all four sides against the work surface to create tension and tighten up the loaf. Place the shaped dough into the banneton, seam side up. Pinch the seam a few times to make sure it stays closed. Cover with oiled plastic wrap.

You can either let the loaves rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, until puffy, and then bake. Alternatively, you can place the shaped loaves in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours for a more sour flavor.

About 30 minutes before baking, remove your loaf from the refrigerator. Form parchment paper to fit inside the dutch oven.
Place a pizza stone in the oven and place Dutch oven on top of it.

Preheat oven to 500F.

When ready to bake, pull the Dutch oven out of your oven and transfer the loaf to the hot pan and score it with your favorite scoring pattern. Spray loaf with water mist.

Carefully return the hot lid to the pan, and place it in the oven, and immediately reduce the oven temperature to 450F.

Bake for 30 minutes, remove the lid, and bake for 15 minutes more, until the crust is a deep brown.

Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
