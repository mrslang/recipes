## Ingredients

### Dipping Liquid

- 0.75 cup strong brewed coffee (cooled)
- 0.25 cup sweet vermouth

### Filling Part 1

- 3 large egg yolks (1.6 oz / 45g), at room temperature
- 0.25 cup sugar (1.8 oz / 50g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 0.5 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 0.25 teaspoon Morton kosher salt
- 0.25 cup strong brewed coffee

### Filling Part 2

- 1 cup mascarpone cheese (8.5 oz / 240g), chilled
- 0.5 cup heavy cream
- 1 (7 oz / 200g) package ladyfingers or savoiardi

### Coating

- 1 cup heavy cream
- Unsweetened cocoa powder, for sprinkling

## Steps

### Prep

Brew 30g dark roasted ground coffee for a total of 1 cup brewed liquid.

Combine "Dipping Liquid" ingredients in shallow bowl.

Lightly wet 8.5 inch by 4.5 inch bread pan and then wrap with plastic wrap. Plastic wrap should have enough overhang to be folded over top in final step.

### Filling Part 1

Place egg yolks in medium bowl

Place granulated sugar, coffee, salt, and vanilla in sauce pan.

Bring to boil, sugar should dissolve.

Slowly stream coffee syrup into egg yolks while beating with hand mixer. This will pasteurize the egg yolks. Do not cook the egg yolks.

Beat until mixture is thick, with a mousse like texture. About 3 minutes. Mixture will have cooled to room temp

### Filling Part 2

In a separate bowl add half cup heavy cream, mascarpone cheese

Whip on medium-high until you get firm peaks.

Scrape mixture from Filling Part 1 into bowl.

Mix on low to combine

Increase speed to medium-high and whip until you get firm peaks again. 1-2 minutes.

### Assemble

Trim ladyfingers to fit width of bread pan. Only first layer will require significant trimming.

Add 0.5 cup of filling to bottom of bread pan and spread thin

Dip ladyfingers into Dipping Liquid and add to bottom of pan one at a time. Dipping should only take 1 sec per ladyfinger because they will absorb liquid quickly and become soggy.

Add 1 cup of filling over the top of the ladyfingers and spread thin.

Repeat dipping ladyfingers and spreading filling (1 cup) until there are a total of 3 layers of ladyfingers.

Add remaining filling (about 0.5 cup) to top.

Fold plastic wrap from pan over the top of the filling.

Refrigerate until filling is completely set, at least 12 hours.

### Coating

Whip 1 cup heavy cream until medium peaks. No additional sugar is needed for coating.

Unwrap plastic from top of refrigerated bread pan.

Invert onto plate.

Coat cake in whipped heavy cream.

Lightly dust with cocoa powder.
