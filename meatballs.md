Cut mozzarella into 0.5 inch cubes.

Mix all wet ingredients in a bowl by hand. Pull apart chunks of meat until just combined. Do not over mix otherwise the balls will be dense.

Mix all the dry ingredients in a separate bowl.

Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients slowly, folding and mixing as you go.

Form meatballs and place a cube of mozzarella in the center of each ball.

Arrange meatballs on a cast iron pan and pour a thin layer of pasta sauce over the top of each ball.
