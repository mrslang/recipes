# Cheese Stuffed Meatballs

## Ingredients

### Wet

- 1 pound jimmy dean regular sausage
- 1 pound ground sirloin
- 2 eggs
- 0.25 cup milk
- 1 tsp pesto
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp minced garlic

### Dry

- 0.75 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
- 0.5 cup grated Parmesan
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- dash of cayenne
- 0.25 tsp everglade all purpose seasoning
- 0.5 tsp italian seasoning

### Finishing

- 0.5 pound fresh mozzarella
- Prego red pasta sauce

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F

Cut mozzarella into chunks if it's not already sliced. Chunks should have a volume of roughly 0.5in^3.

Mix all wet ingredients in a bowl by hand. Pull apart chunks of meat until just combined. Do not over mix otherwise the balls will be dense.

Mix all the dry ingredients in a separate bowl.

Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients slowly, folding and mixing as you go.

Form meatballs into spheres. Aim for a weight of XX grams.

Press a chunk of mozzarella in the center of each ball and reform the ball around it.

Arrange meatballs on a cast iron pan and pour a thin layer of pasta sauce over the top of each ball.

Bake meatballs for 35-40 minutes or until internal temp hits 160F (safe temp for ground beef). Cheese coming out of the meatballs is another good indicator to stop cooking. Cooking time will vary greatly based on size of balls.
