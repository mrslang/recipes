# Hard Boiled Eggs

Add about 1 inch of water to a pot with a steamer basket inside.

Heat the water on high heat until it is boiling and producing steam.

Gently place the eggs at the bottom of the steamer basket and cover the pot.

Set timer for:

- 6 minutes for soft boiled
- 10 minutes for hard boiled with a still translucent and bright yolk
- 12-15 minutes for cooked-through hard boiled

After cooking, run cold water directly into the pot to cover the eggs and quickly cool them down.
