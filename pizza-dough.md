# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients

### Dry

- 150 grams 00 flour
- 150 grams all-purpose flour
- 8 grams fine salt

### Wet

- 250 grams lukewarm water (100F)
- 2 grams active dry yeast
- 4 grams extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions

In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients.

In a small mixing bowl, stir together wet ingredients. Pour into flour mixture.

Knead until well combined, approximately 3 minutes

Let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.

While mixture is resting lay out 2 pieces of parchment paper, at least as large as your pizza peel.

Knead rested dough for 3 minutes.

Separate dough into 2 equal pieces and place each piece in the center of a sheet of parchment paper. They are now glued to the parchment paper and will remain attached until they are done cooking.

Cover with a large bowl to prevent dough from drying out. Bowl should be large enough that it will not touch the dough while it rises.

Let dough rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza. Rise time will depend on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen.

Flour your hands heavily and use your fingers to stretch the dough while it is still attached to the parchment paper. Do not work the crust of the pizza - doing so will pop the air bubbles that formed while rising and lead to a less fluffy crust.

Top pizza dough with sauce and toppings. Apply a thin layer of sauce and avoid toppings that will release too much moisture when cooking.

Bake in the grill on a pizza stone. Temperature of the grill should be around 600F and will cook for about 7 minutes. Parchment paper will separate cleanly after baking.

## Notes

Need to experiment with higher grill temps.

You can test to see if yeast is alive by feeding it 1tsp sugar during "stir together wet ingredients" step.
