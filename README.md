A bunch of recipes I've made / collected.

## Notes

### Brown Sugar

I've edited these recipes to replace brown sugar with white sugar plus molasses.

Brown sugar that you buy for cooking is just white sugar with molasses added in. However, it's far less convenient than keeping the two ingredients separate because:

- Brown sugar solidifies into a brick, whereas white sugar and molasses are stable for years.
- Brown sugar is an extra ingredient to keep stocked, especially if you have recipes that call for light or dark brown sugar variants.
