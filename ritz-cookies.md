# Ritz Cookies

## Ingredients

- 35g food grade paraffin wax (Gulf Wax)
- 11oz white chocolate chips
- Ritz crackers
- smooth peanut butter

## Steps

Spread peanut butter on cracker. Top with second cracker. Repeat with all remaining crackers until they are all turned into cracker sandwiches.

Freeze in a plastic bag for at least an hour. This will prevent the peanut butter from melting into the chocolate when dipping.

Prepare double boiler.

Melt together paraffin wax and white chocolate chips

Put a sheet of parchment paper on a wire cooling rack.

Using a fork, dip each cracker sandwich into white chocolate mixture, knock off excess chocolate by tapping fork on side of double boiler, scrape off bottom of fork on edge of double boiler, and set cookie on parchment paper using the edge of a knife to push it off the fork.

Wait for cookies to cool & solidify.
