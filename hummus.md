# Hummus

## Ingredients

### First Step

- 15.5 oz can chickpeas
- 0.5 cups tahini, well mixed
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp garlic paste
- 0.75 tsp (or more) kosher salt
- 10 cranks freshly ground black pepper
- 0.25 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tbsp water

### Finishing

- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- Za’atar and/or sesame seeds (for serving)

## Steps

Drain chickpeas in a strainer and rinse thoroughly.

Combine all "First Step" ingredients in a food processor. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.

With the motor running, stream in olive oil, then continue to process until hummus is very light and creamy, about 1 minute longer. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Transfer hummus to a shallow bowl, top with za’atar and/or sesame seeds, and drizzle with more oil.
